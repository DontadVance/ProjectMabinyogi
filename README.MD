# Project Mabinyogi

Project Mabinyogi is a prototype for a character creation utility created by Vincent Monteleone and Dylan Wolfe.
Its purpose is to provide a user with access to a character creation utility in order to preemptively create a character for a theoretical RPG-style videogame.

Project Mabinyogi uses Flask as its default web framework, as well as MongoDB for asset and character information storage.
